You are given a list of browser tab titles opened by a user.

Your task is to group them into meaningful high-level categories that reflect the purpose of each tab. Focus on what the user was trying to do — not the literal wording of the title.

Return only a valid JSON object in this format:
{
  "Category Name": ["Tab Title 1", "Tab Title 2", ...],
  ...
}

Guidelines:
- Make the category names short and clear (1–3 words), e.g. "Entertainment", "School Research", "Shopping", "Email", "Travel Plans".
- Avoid vague categories like "Other", "Misc", or "General".
- You can create your own categories — just keep them useful and intuitive.
- Every tab title must be included exactly once in one category.
- If a tab is called exactly "New Tab", group it under "New Tabs".
- If a tab includes "Google Search", categorize it by the topic being searched. For example:
  - "how to book cheap flights - Google Search" → "Travel"
  - "is coffee good for you - Google Search" → "Health"

Output must be valid JSON and nothing else. No comments, no extra text.

Here is the list of tab titles:
