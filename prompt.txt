You are given a list of browser tab titles.

Your task is to group them into categories based on the **actual purpose or intent** behind each tab — not the exact text.

You must return a **valid JSON object only**, structured like this:

{
  "Category 1": ["Title A", "Title B"],
  "Category 2": ["Title C", "Title D"]
}

---

### Strict Rules:

1. Choose categories **only** from this approved list:
   - "Work", "Research", "Entertainment", "Education", "Shopping", "Social Media", "News", "Email", "Documentation", "Productivity", "Finance", "Travel", "Technology", "Weather", "Health", "Food", "New Tabs"

2. If a tab is **'New Tab'**, assign it to `"New Tabs"`.

3. NEVER use categories like "Search", "Other", "Miscellaneous", or create new ones.

4. If a tab includes "Google Search", classify it by the actual topic searched:
   - "weather in Paris - Google Search" → "Weather"
   - "how to get a scholarship - Google Search" → "Education"

5. Each tab must be assigned to **exactly one** of the approved categories.
