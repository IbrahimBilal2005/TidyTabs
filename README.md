# 🧠 TidyTabs AI — Smart Tab Organizer for Chrome
### Ever have 27 tabs open and no idea why?

You're not alone. Between research, YouTube, email, and five versions of “how to focus better,” it’s easy for your browser to become a digital jungle.

**Tab Organizer** is a Chrome extension powered by GPT-4 that declutters your browser in one click.  
It scans your open tabs and intelligently groups them by topic—like **Productivity**, **Entertainment**, **Beach Plan**, and more—so you can breathe, focus, and actually find what you were looking for.

No more tab overload. No more chaos. A lot more oganization.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. 🧐 **Understands your tabs with context**  
   GPT-4 doesn’t just scan for keywords — it reads your tab titles and figures out the *real* purpose behind them.

2. 🗂️ **Categorizes them like a pro**  
   Tabs are sorted into intelligent groups like **Research**, **Entertainment**, **Work**, and more — no setup needed.

3. 🌈 **Adds color-coded clarity**  
   Each group gets a distinct Chrome tab color, turning your tab bar into an organized rainbow instead of a chaotic wall.

4. ⌨️ **Keeps you updated with a typewriter touch**  
   Instead of boring spinners, you’ll see smooth, animated messages like “Analyzing tabs…” and “Grouping by topic…”

5. 🚀 **Done in seconds — zero effort**  
   Before you know it, your tabs are neatly grouped and labeled. You stay in flow, without lifting a finger.
